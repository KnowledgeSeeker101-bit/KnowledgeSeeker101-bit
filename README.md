### Hi, I'm Nyashadzaishe Masvongo aka Knowledge_Seeker101 👋

I am a results-driven Machine Learning Engineer with a proven ability to build high-performing models from scratch. I specialize in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Synthesis, and I have a passion for creating AI solutions for low-resource African languages.

My skills are not just theoretical; I have a consistent track record of top-tier finishes in Zindi data science competitions, regularly placing in the top 10% against thousands of competitors.

* 🌱 I’m currently building an open-source Speech-to-Speech (STS) model for the Shona language and Twi with my colluage Duke Congo aka CodeJoe.
* 🏆 I am a multi-time competition winner/finalist on the Zindi Africa platform.
